# Notebooks

This folder contains Databricks Notebook style files (as `.py`).

They access `dbx_example` Python project, so it can be used as:
* Databricks Git Repo
* Local IDE (Project installed as 'editable')
* Workflows with the Project linked as a Wheel
    * Unfortunately setting an environment or libraries seems not possible on Serverless Compute in a Workflow
