# Databricks Bundle Example

This project is an example implementation of a [Databricks Asset Bundle](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/) using a [Databricks Free Edition](https://www.databricks.com/learn/free-edition) workspace.

The project is configured using `pyproject.toml` (Python specifics) and `databricks.yaml` (Databricks Bundle specifics) and uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the Python project and dependencies.

## Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.github/workflows` | CI/CD jobs to test and deploy bundle |
| `dab_project` | Python project (Used in Databricks Workflow as Python-Wheel-Task) |
| `dbt` | [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) project<br/>* Used in Databricks Workflow as dbt-Task<br/>* dbt-Models used from https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_duckdb |
| `resources` | Resources such as Databricks Workflows or Databricks Volumes/Schemas<br/>* Python-based workflow: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/python<br/>* YAML-based Workflow: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/resources#job |
| `scripts` | Python script to setup groups, service principals and catalogs used in a Databricks (Free Edition) workspace |
| `tests` | Unit-tests running on Databricks (via Connect) or locally<br/>* Used in [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) jobs |

## Databricks Workspace

For this example we use a Databricks Free Edition workspace https://www.databricks.com/learn/free-edition with all resources and identities managed in the Workspace (no external connections or Cloud Identity Management).

### Setup

Groups and Service Principals are not necessary, but are used in this project to showcase handling permissions on resources such as catalogs or workflows.

* **Serverless environment version 3**, which matches [Databricks Runtime 16.3](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/release-notes/serverless/#version-163)
* **Catalogs**: `lake_dev`, `lake_test` and `lake_prod`
* **Service principals** (for CI/CD and Workflow runners)
  * `sp_etl_dev` (for dev and test) and `sp_etl_prod` (for prod)
  * Make sure the User used to deploy Workflows has `Service principal: User` on the used service principals
* **Groups**
  * `group_etl` group with `ALL PRIVILEGES` and `group_reader` with limited permissions on catalogs
  * These are mostly to test applying grants using Asset Bundle resources

A script exists set up the (Free) Workspace as described in [scripts/setup_workspace.py](scripts/setup_workspace.py), more on that in the Development section.

## Development

### Requirements

* uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
  * `uv` will default to Python version specified in [.python-version](.python-version)
* Databricks CLI: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/install
  * ">=0.259.0" for Python based workflows with `environment_version`

### Setup environment

Sync entire `uv` environment with dev dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

> **Note:** we install Databricks Connect in a follow-up step

#### (Optional) Activate virtual environment

Bash:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Databricks Connect

Install `databricks-connect` in active environment. This requires authentication being set up via Databricks CLI.
a
```bash
uv pip uninstall pyspark
uv pip install databricks-connect==16.3.5
```
> **Note:** For Databricks Runtime 16.3

See https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/vscode-ext/ for using Databricks Connect extension in VS Code.

### Unit-Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

Based on whether Databricks Connect is enabled or not the Unit-Tests try to use a Databricks Cluster or start a local Spark session with Delta support.
* On Databricks the unit-tests currently assume the catalog `lake_dev` exists.

> **Note:** For local Spark Java is required. On Windows Spark/Delta requires HADOOP libraries and generally does not run well, opt for `wsl` instead.

### Checks

```bash
# Linting
uv run ruff check --fix
# Formatting
uv run ruff format
```

### Setup Databricks Workspace

The following script sets up a Databricks (Free Edition) Workspace for this project with additional catalogs, groups and service principals. It uses both Databricks-SDK and Databricks Connect (Serverless).

```bash
# Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
# databricks configure

uv run ./scripts/setup_workspace.py
```

## Databricks CLI

1. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

2. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```

3. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

4. Deploy with custom variables
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev --var "catalog_name=workspace"
   ```

## FAQ

* Why no `src` directory?

   Working in Databricks Git Repos automatically adds the root of the Git Repo to Python `sys.path`.

   This way Notebooks in the Git Repo can run `import dab_project` to import the local Python package during development without explicitly installing the package on the Cluster.

   A Notebook outside the Git Repo can do `import os; os.chdir("/Workspace/Users/...")` to act like it is within the Git Repo.

   Using a `src` directory requires changing the `sys.path` during development (without package installed) in a Databricks Git Repo.
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append("../src")
   ```
* Service Principals

   For this example, the targets `test` and `prod` use a group and service principals.

   The group `group_etl` can manage the workflow, ideally your user and the service principal are part of it. This group should also have sufficient permissions on the used Catalogs.

   Make sure the User used to deploy has `Service principal: User` permissions. `Service principal: Manager` is not enough.
* dbt project

   The `dbt` project is based on https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_duckdb with following changes:

   * Schema bronze, silver, gold
   * documented materialization `use_materialization_v2`
   * Primary, Foreign Key Constraints

## TODO:

* Resources (volume, schema, permissions)
* Streaming example
* Logging
  * Logging to volume
